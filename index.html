                <h3>Activity Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>The Feedback Loop Mystery</strong> engages students in hands-on investigation of how surface color affects solar energy absorption. Teams build two identical boxes with different colored linings and systematically measure temperature changes to discover albedo principles. Students connect their findings to ice-albedo feedback loops that accelerate climate change, understanding how melting Arctic ice creates conditions that lead to further warming.</p>
